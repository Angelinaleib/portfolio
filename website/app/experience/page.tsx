            At a SaaS startup, I worked as a student data analyst, supporting data-driven
            decision-making across business and operational processes. I contributed to the
            consolidation and analysis of data from multiple systems, creating clear reports and
            dashboards that improved transparency and reduced manual effort.

            In addition, I supported the improvement of internal data structures and reporting
            workflows, helping make complex system and business data more accessible and usable
            for non-technical stakeholders.

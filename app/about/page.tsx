      <p>I am currently sutdying business informatics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen. 
        I have practical experience from working as a student data analyst in a SaaS startup, where I supported data analysis, reporting, and system-related decision processes.
        My background is in business informatics, with a strong interest in how digital systems shape human behavior, perception, and decision-making.
        Currently, I explore topics such as data bias, AI ethics, and human–technology interaction through small projects and short essays. I’m especially interested in reflective, human-centered approaches to technology rather than purely technical solutions.
        Alongside this, I maintain a creative practice, using visual work as a way to think, observe, and experiment beyond formal structures.</p>
